# Who am I?

* https://skippy.net/
* Linux user since 1999
* Professional systems administrator
* OLF enthusiast  

---
# Why should you listen to me?

* You probably shouldn’t. 
* I don’t run DNS at scale. 
* I only tinker.

---
# What is DNS?

Who knows what DNS stands for? 

---
# What is DNS?

* Domain Name System
* Translate friendly names to IP addresses
* And a whole lot more!

---
# DNS History

Who knows when the first DNS RFC was published?

Or the first DNS RFC number?

---
# DNS History

* November 1983
* RFC 882

BIND: Berkeley Internet Name Daemon

# DNS Software

**Authoritative** servers hold records that answer DNS queries.

**Recursive** servers do not hold records, and ask authoritative servers for answers.

**Caching** servers store answers for some period of time.

* Many choices of DNS server software
* All have different features, benefits and drawbacks

# What is CoreDNS?

> CoreDNS is a  [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)  server. It is written in  [Go](https://golang.org/) . It can be used in a multitude of environments because of its flexibility. CoreDNS is licensed under the  [Apache License Version 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) , and completely open source. 

---
# What is CoreDNS? 

> CoreDNS chains  [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins) . Each plugin performs a DNS function, such as  [Kubernetes service discovery](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes) ,  [prometheus metrics](https://coredns.io/plugins/metrics) ,  [rewriting queries](https://coredns.io/plugins/rewrite) , or *just* serving from  [zone files](https://coredns.io/plugins/file) . And  [many](https://coredns.io/plugins/)   [more](https://coredns.io/explugins/) .

# History of CoreDNS

* started its life as a fork of the  [Caddy web(!)server](https://caddyserver.com/) 
* [version 001](https://coredns.io/2016/09/18/coredns-001-release/) released Sep 2016
* Joined [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://coredns.io/2017/03/02/why-cncf-for-coredns/) July 2017

---
# CoreDNS features

* Written in [Go](https://golang.org/)
* Single binary
* Supported [container](https://hub.docker.com/u/coredns)
* [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) official project

---
# CoreDNS features

* Authoritative DNS server (**not** a recursive resolver)
* Plugins for caching, forwarding, rewriting, logging, and more!
* Multiple protocol support (UDP, [gRPC](https://coredns.io/plugins/grpc/), [DNS over TLS](https://coredns.io/plugins/tls/))

---
# Why use it (at home)?

* non-root user
* easy to test
* easy to automate
* control your DNS lookups
* protect your DNS lookups

---
# Demo: No config 

```basic
./coredns -dns.port 1053
```

```basic
dig @localhost -p 1053 ohiolinux.org
```

---
# Demo: whoami

> The whoami plugin is not really that useful, but can be used for having a simple (fast) endpoint to test clients against. When whoami returns a response it will have your client’s IP address in the additional section as either an A or AAAA record.

```basic
whoami.org:1053 {
  whoami
  log
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.0.whoami
```

```basic
dig @localhost -p 1053 whoami.org
```

> If CoreDNS can’t find a Corefile on startup this is the default plugin that gets loaded. As such it can be used to check that CoreDNS is responding to queries. Other than that this plugin is of limited use in production.

# Demo: health

```basic
whoami.org:1053 {
  whoami
  health
  log
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.1.health
```

```basic
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

---
# Demo: forward

```basic
.:1053 {
  forward . 9.9.9.9 1.1.1.1
  health
  log
  cache 300
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.2.forward
```

```basic
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
dig @localhost -p 1053 ohiolinux.org
```

---
# Demo: DNS over TLS

quad9.net:
```
openssl s_client -connect 9.9.9.9:853
```

cloudflare-dns.com:
```
openssl s_client -connect 1.1.1.1:853
```

---
# Demo: DNS over TLS
```basic
.:1053 {
  forward . tls://9.9.9.9 tls://149.112.112.112 {
    tls_servername dns.quad9.net
    health_check 5s
  }
  health
  log
  cache 300
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.3.tls
```

```basic
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
dig @localhost -p 1053 ohiolinux.org
```
