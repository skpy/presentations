* I only tinker.

# What is DNS?

Who knows what DNS stands for? 

---
# What is DNS?

# DNS Software

**Authoritative** servers hold records that answer DNS queries.

**Recursive** servers do not hold records, and ask authoritative servers for answers.

**Caching** servers store answers for some period of time.

* Many choices of DNS server software
* All have different features, benefits and drawbacks

# What is CoreDNS?

> CoreDNS is a  [DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)  server. It is written in  [Go](https://golang.org/) . It can be used in a multitude of environments because of its flexibility. CoreDNS is licensed under the  [Apache License Version 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) , and completely open source. 

---
# What is CoreDNS? 

> CoreDNS chains  [plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins) . Each plugin performs a DNS function, such as  [Kubernetes service discovery](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes) ,  [prometheus metrics](https://coredns.io/plugins/metrics) ,  [rewriting queries](https://coredns.io/plugins/rewrite) , or *just* serving from  [zone files](https://coredns.io/plugins/file) . And  [many](https://coredns.io/plugins/)   [more](https://coredns.io/explugins/) .

# History of CoreDNS

* started its life as a fork of the  [Caddy web(!)server](https://caddyserver.com/) 
* [version 001](https://coredns.io/2016/09/18/coredns-001-release/) released Sep 2016
* Joined [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://coredns.io/2017/03/02/why-cncf-for-coredns/) July 2017

---
# CoreDNS features

* Written in [Go](https://golang.org/)
* Single binary
* Supported [container](https://hub.docker.com/u/coredns)
* [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) official project

---
# CoreDNS features

* Authoritative DNS server (**not** a recursive resolver)
* Plugins for caching, forwarding, rewriting, logging, and more!
* Multiple protocol support (UDP, [gRPC](https://coredns.io/plugins/grpc/), [DNS over TLS](https://coredns.io/plugins/tls/))

---
# Why use it (at home)?

* non-root user
* easy to test
* easy to automate
* control your DNS lookups
* protect your DNS lookups

# Demo: No config 

```basic
./coredns -dns.port 1053
```

```basic
dig @localhost -p 1053 ohiolinux.org
```

---
# Demo: whoami

```basic
whoami.org:1053 {
  whoami
  log
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.0.whoami
```

```basic
dig @localhost -p 1053 whoami.org
```

---
# Demo: health

```basic
whoami.org:1053 {
  whoami
  health
  log
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.1.health
```

```basic
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

---
# Demo: forward

```basic
.:1053 {
  forward . 9.9.9.9 1.1.1.1
  health
  log
  cache 300
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.2.forward
```

```basic
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
dig @localhost -p 1053 ohiolinux.org
```

---
# Demo: DNS over TLS

```basic
.:1053 {
  forward . tls://9.9.9.9 tls://149.112.112.112 {
    tls_servername dns.quad9.net
    health_check 5s
  }
  health
  log
  cache 300
}
```

```basic
./coredns -conf Corefile.3.tls
```

```basic
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
dig @localhost -p 1053 ohiolinux.org
